# PowerShell.tmLanguage
tmLanguage JSON file from VS Code for PowerShell language syntax scoping

This repository is for making adjustments to the PowerShell language grammer syntax scoping file used by VS Code, a JSON formatted file.

The purpose of the adjustments are to try making improvements in the scoping (and thus theming) of PowerShell script language documents while editing with VS Code.

The PowerShell/EditorSyntax repository is the official source of the VS Code tmLanguage document, but it is in the formal tmLanguage XML PList format.
