IF statement logic

WHILE       (condition)     {statements}

after detecting the keyword, 
    BEGIN with "\G" (and not any invalid chars)
    END with "\(" (or any invalid chars, maybe just any "\S")
    PATTERNS 
        available switches
        notCode

This will these items to just immediately after the keyword.

ESLEIF needs to loop, be recursive, on its own
ELSE needs to be the last chance to match, this might beed to be done in the root of IF.
Need to not get caught on nested IF's that close together, need to make sure to completely close out of one statement, so the end of the next one can be detected!

Its possible that either an expression is ending `)` or a scriptblock is ending `}`.
Its also possible a new expression `(` or a new scriptblock `{` may follow.
Recursive to $SELF is the only way to prevent refire of `(` or `{`

This mean ELSE and ELSEIF must both be found recursively, so the syntax always moves forward until there is a clearly delimiting character (in this case, a line end)

Remember, use begin when something is next, end when !\G to return immediately after the end.

   <---------------------> repeatable
IF(cond){statements}ELSEIF(cond){statments} 
                    ^^^^^^ Optional, but terminates repeating without it
                    ELSE{statements} <- alternate ending

AdvanceToToken
Begin when `(` is next
End with any character not processed or end of line
    include common `(cond){statements}ELSEIF` patterns
    Begin with `ELSE`
